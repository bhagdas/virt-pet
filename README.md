# Virtual Pet Simulator

## Overview
The **Virtual Pet Simulator** is a Python-based command-line application that allows users to adopt, care for, and interact with virtual pets. Each pet has unique attributes such as happiness and hunger, which change over time and through user interactions.

## Features
- **Adopt a Pet**: Create a new virtual pet with customizable names.
- **Interact with Pets**: Play, feed, or poop on your pet, which affects their happiness and hunger levels.
- **Lifespan Management**: Each pet has a random lifespan and will eventually pass away.
- **Rehome Pets**: Remove pets from your list if you're unable to care for them.
- **Persistent Storage**: Pets are saved to files, enabling persistence between sessions.
